Problem 1
Reading in the dataset using read_csv. We will now create a city_with_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary variable showing if the homicide was solved. Additionally, we will also remove the follwing states - Phoenix, AZ; Dallas, TX; and Kansas City, MO as these states do not report the victim's races and also Tulsa, AL as this seems to be an error in data entry.

Next we will modify victim_race such that it has the categories white and non-white, making white the reference category and making victim_age numeric.

```{r}
hom_df = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv", col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(city_with_state = str_c(city, ",", " ", state),
         solved = if_else(disposition == "Closed by arrest", "resolved", "unresolved"),
         solved = fct_relevel(solved, "unresolved"),
         victim_race = tolower(victim_race),
         colpsd_victim_race = fct_collapse(victim_race, "non-white" = c("asian","black", "hispanic", "other", "unknown")),
         colpsd_victim_race = fct_relevel(colpsd_victim_race, "white"),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>% 
  filter(!(city_with_state %in% c("Phoenix, AZ", "Dallas, TX", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")))

```

Let us now use the glm function to fit a logistic regression for the city of Baltimore, M.D. wherein the outcome is dichotomous (resolved vs unresolved) and the predictors are victim age, sex and race. Additionally, let us obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing non-white victims to white victims keeping all the other variables constant.

```{r}

balt_df = hom_df %>% 
  filter(city_with_state == "Baltimore, MD")

logis_balt = glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + colpsd_victim_race, data = balt_df, family = binomial())

logis_balt %>% broom::tidy() %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         lower_95_ci = exp(estimate - (1.96 * std_error)),
         upper_95_ci = exp(estimate + (1.96 * std_error))) %>% 
  filter(term == "colpsd_victim_racenon-white") %>% 
  select(OR, lower_95_ci, upper_95_ci) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

```

From the above, we know the odds of solving homicides in non-white victims vs white victims is 0.441 after adjusting for sex and age. We are also 95% confident that the odss lie between 0.31 and 0.62.

Next, we will run the glm function for each one of the cities and extract the adjusted odds ratio and CI for solving homicides comparing non-white victims to white victims.

```{r}

logis_cities = hom_df %>% 
  
  # variable selection
  select(city_with_state, solved, victim_age, victim_sex, colpsd_victim_race) %>%
  
  # Iterations
  group_by(city_with_state) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  
  # Using maps for iterating the tidy and glm functions
  mutate(models = map(.x = data, ~ glm(solved ~ victim_sex + colpsd_victim_race + victim_age, family = binomial, data = .x)),
  models = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-data) %>% unnest() %>% 
  filter(term == "colpsd_victim_racenon-white") %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
  # Calculating the 95% confidence intervals
         lower_95_ci = exp(estimate - (1.96*std.error)),
         upper_95_ci = exp(estimate + (1.96*std.error))) %>% 
  select(city_with_state, OR, lower_95_ci, upper_95_ci) %>% 
  
  # Organizing cities from the lowest to the highest as per estimated ORs 
  mutate(city_with_state = reorder(city_with_state, OR))

```

Let us create a plot showing the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

```{r}

ggplot(logis_cities, aes(x = city_with_state, y = OR)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_95_ci, ymax = upper_95_ci)) + 
  coord_flip() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 1.00), linetype = "dashed", color = "blue") + 
  labs(
    y = "OR (95% Confidence interval)",
    x = "City, State"
  )

```

With the exceptions of Birmingham, Tampa, Durham, we see that in almost all of the cities the odds ratio lies below 1.0. This indicates that in almost all of the cities, the odds of solving a homicide for non-whites is less than that of the white category, after cotrolling for sex and age. However, since the confidence intervals for almost about half of those include the null value of 1, we can conclude that these results are not statistically significant.

Problem 2

```{r}

child_df = read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  mutate(babysex = as.factor(babysex),
         frace = as.factor(frace),
         mrace = as.factor(mrace),
         malform = as.factor(malform))

# let us now check if there are missing variables in any of the observations
filter_all(child_df, any_vars(is.na(.)))

sum(is.na(hom_df))

```

We find no missing obervations for the variables.

The hypothesis is that the gestational age in weeks is associated with baby's birthweight. We will adjust for baby's sex, mother age, sex, race, weight gain and average number of cigarettes smoked daily during pregnancy to test this hypothesis. Since the outcome of interest is continuous, we can do linear regression.

Let us now look at the distribution of the two variables.
